        Exotic butters <br>
        Over the hill <br>
        Speak the speech, I pray you, as I have pronounced it to you <br>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do shape the darling buds of may, and summer's lease hath all too short a date.
        The butter near the nut goes halfway round the rut
